LANGUAGE TRANSLATION FILES FOR IMSANITY
---------------------------------------

If you are interested in creating a language translation for Imsanity then
you've found the right place!  Your help is greatly appreciated and allows
Imsanity to be more easily used by people all over the world.
Imsanity uses the language that is configured for WordPress in wp-config.php
and so it can support any language for which a translation has been provided.

The language files used by WordPress and Imsanity are extremely simple
to create and edit, however a plugin or software application is required to work
with the file formats.  The only difficult part is actually translating the
text into the new language!

A ".po" file is a plain text file that you edit using a plugin or application.
You simply enter a tranlations for each phrase.  Once all of the phrases have 
been translated, you use the software to generate an ".mo" file.  Save both
of these files in the imsanity/languages folder and it will be used on 
all imsanity configuration pages.

HOW TO CREATE OR UPDATE TRANSLATION FILES:

The easiest way to create WordPress translations is with the Codestyling Localization
plugin at http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/ .  After
installing the plugin, simply login as admin and go to Tools -> Localization.  
Refer to the plugin documentation for instructions.

If you prefer desktop software, POEdit is a free application to view and
edit translation files: http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/  You can copy
and use one of the existing .po files as a starting point.

There's plenty of video tutorials that you can find by searching YouTube
for "po files"

WHAT DO I DO ONCE I'VE CREATED A TRANSLATION FILE FOR IMSANITY?

Once you have created the .po and .mo files, zip them up and upload them
to either a file sharing service, your own blog, or any public server
where I can download them.

Once the files are available, post a message on the Imsanity Support Forum at 
http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/imsanity and let me know where to get
them.

Thank you for supporting Imsanity and all free software!
